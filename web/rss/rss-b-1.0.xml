<title>The Talmud as a Business Guide</title>
<link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2134472</link>
<description>Free paper by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=638928&#x22;&#x3E;Hershey H. Friedman&#x3C;/a&#x3E;  last revised on 2012-08-23
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;Purpose: There is a great deal of interest in discovering the secrets of business success according to the Talmud. This interest is satisfied in the present paper by listing and explaining some principles, stories, and cases from the Talmud.  Approach: The topic is approached in the manner of analysis of the Talmud as a business guide and as a set of stories and cases (part seven).  Findings: Some of the Talmudic sages were indeed quite wealthy (introduction). This paper demonstrates that the Talmudic approach to becoming wealthy (part two) involves respecting hard work, leading an ethical life, being charitable, treating employees well, going beyond the strict requirements of the law, and caring for others (parts three to six).  Implications: There are some indirect (conceptual) and some direct (in terms of principles and cases) implications of the Talmud as a business guide (as shown in part seven).  Methodology: Conceptual approach with addition of some Talmud stories as case studies. </description>
