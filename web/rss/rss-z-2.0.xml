&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;We find a U&#x26;#x2010;shaped relation between happiness and religiosity in cross&#x26;#x2010;country panel data after controlling for income levels. At a given level of income, the same level of happiness can be reached with high and low levels of religiosity, but not with intermediate levels. A rise in income causes an increase in happiness along with a decline of religiosity. Our interpretation of the empirical results is that the indifference curves for religiosity and other commodities of the utility function are hump&#x26;#x2010;shaped. </description>
