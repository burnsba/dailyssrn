<title>Bankruptcy Probabilities Inferred from Option Prices</title>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;Option prices contain forward looking information about stock price volatility and, potentially, the probability of bankruptcy. We develop a risk-neutral density (RND) model consisting of a mixture of two lognormal densities with a probability of bankruptcy. We calibrate this model to daily stock and option prices of six financial institutions during the onset of the financial crisis to see what information about bankruptcy probabilities can be inferred from option prices. The bankruptcy probability and the shape of the RND for the institutions are examined, particularly on major event dates. The empirical results show that acquiring banks have a lower bankruptcy probability than the acquired banks; RNDs of financial institutions reflect market shocks, especially in fat tails and bankruptcy probability. The results from multivariate regressions for each institution suggest that the small volatile firms, with low returns, have a higher chance of bankruptcy than large stable firms with high returns. </description>

<title>Revisiting the Fractional Cointegrating Dynamics of Implied-Realized Volatility Relation with Wavelet Band Spectrum Regression</title>
<link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2135176</link>
<description>Free paper by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1823738&#x22;&#x3E;Jozef Barunik&#x3C;/a&#x3E;  and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1886131&#x22;&#x3E;Michaela Barunikova&#x3C;/a&#x3E;  last revised on 2012-08-24
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;This paper revisits the fractional cointegrating relationship between ex-ante implied volatility and ex-post realized volatility. We argue that the concept of corridor implied volatility (CIV) should be used instead of the popular model-free option-implied volatility (MFIV) when assessing the fractional cointegrating relation as the latter may introduce bias to the estimation. For the realized volatility, we use recently proposed methods which are robust to noise as well as jumps and interestingly we find that it does not affect the implied-realized volatility relation. In addition, we develop a new tool for the estimation of fractional cointegrating relation between implied and realized volatility based on wavelets, a wavelet band least squares (WBLS). The main advantage of WBLS in comparison to other frequency domain methods is that it allows us to work conveniently with potentially non-stationary volatility due to the properties of wavelets. We study the dynamics of the relationship in the time-frequency domain with the wavelet coherence confirming that the dependence comes solely from the lower frequencies of the spectra. Motivated by this result we estimate the relationship only on this part of the spectra using WBLS and compare our results to the fully modified narrow-band least squares (FMNBLS) based on the Fourier frequencies. In the estimation, we use the S&#x26;#x26;P 500 and DAX monthly and bi-weekly option prices covering the recent financial crisis and we conclude that in the long-run, volatility inferred from the option prices using the corridor implied volatility (CIV) provides an unbiased forecast of the realized volatility. </description>

<title>Determinants of Household Demand for Services - Formal Versus Informal Sector</title>
<link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2134966</link>
<description>Free paper by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=1754067&#x22;&#x3E;Izabela Styczy&#x144;ska&#x3C;/a&#x3E;  last revised on 2012-08-24
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;This paper addresses the issue of household demand for services in Poland when informal sector is taken into consideration. The aim of the study is threefold: (i) to investigate the factors influencing households expenses for services, (ii) to find the determinants of households&#x26;#x2019; tax strategy (choice between acquiring services on regular labour market or not), (iii) to investigate the differences between the factors that influence the expenses for formal versus informal services. Two-step Heckman selection model is used to account for the selection into buying household services. Lee&#x26;#x2019;s (1983) procedure is adopted to control for the selection into the particular choice of tax strategy when purchasing household services. The decision whether to buy household services and whether formally or informally is modelled as a sequential choice and estimated by bivariate probit with selection. An important novel feature of the model used is the inclusion of variables that capture social norms and personal attitudes toward tax evasion. The study concludes that factors influencing expenses for services are positively related to financial situation of households, education and age of household head. The probability of avoiding taxes is higher for lower income households, households with more than one member and for those where a positive attitude toward informal employment is expressed. The impact of determinants of expenses for formal and informal services separately is comparable. Only household structure has the opposite effect on expenses for formal services versus informal ones. </description>

<title>Inequity in the Face of Death</title>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;We apply the theory of inequality in opportunity to measure inequity in mortality. Our empirical work is based on a rich dataset for the Netherlands (1998-2007), linking information about mortality, health events and lifestyles. We show that distinguishing between different channels via which mortality is affected is necessary to test the sensitivity of the results with respect to different normative positions. Moreover, our model allows for a comparison of the inequity in simulated counterfactual situations, including an evaluation of policy measures. We explicitly make a distinction between inequity in mortality risks and inequity in mortality outcomes. The treatment of this difference - &#x26;#x201C;luck&#x26;#x201D; - has a crucial in&#x26;#x2021;uence on the results. </description>

<title>Job Characteristics and Labor Market Discrimination in Promotions: New Theory and Empirical Evidence</title>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;We present new theory and empirical evidence concerning racial discrimination in promotions. In our model, promotions signal worker ability. When tasks differ substantially across levels of a job hierarchy, the opportunity cost (in terms of foregone output) of not promoting qualified nonwhite workers is large, so employers are less likely to inefficiently retain these workers in lower-level jobs. Thus, given pre-promotion performance, the extent to which nonwhite workers have lower promotion probabilities should decrease when tasks vary more across levels. Also, the difference between white and nonwhite workers in the wage increase attached to promotion should diminish when tasks vary more across levels. We test these implications empirically using personnel data from a large U.S. firm and from the National Compensation Survey. Results support the theoretical model&#x26;#x2019;s predictions concerning promotion probabilities, whereas support is mixed for the model&#x26;#x2019;s predictions concerning the wage growth attached to promotions. </description>

<title>Religiosity as a Determinant of Happiness</title>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;We find a U&#x26;#x2010;shaped relation between happiness and religiosity in cross&#x26;#x2010;country panel data after controlling for income levels. At a given level of income, the same level of happiness can be reached with high and low levels of religiosity, but not with intermediate levels. A rise in income causes an increase in happiness along with a decline of religiosity. Our interpretation of the empirical results is that the indifference curves for religiosity and other commodities of the utility function are hump&#x26;#x2010;shaped. </description>

<title>Can Company Disclosures Discipline State-Appointed Managers? Evidence from Greek Privatizations</title>
<link>http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2135343</link>
<description>Free paper by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=591462&#x22;&#x3E;Stavros Gadinis&#x3C;/a&#x3E;  last revised on 2012-08-24
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;Conventional economic theory portrays privatization as a transformative event for a company, even when it is partial and the state maintains control. According to this view, private investors have stronger incentives than voters to monitor management performance and constrain side-payments to political allies of the government. But how exactly can private investors discipline managers they cannot fire? Proponents of privatization place their hopes on disclosure obligations under securities laws, triggered by privatized companies&#x26;#x27; stock exchange listings. They argue that, because company disclosures can reveal side-payments to government allies and cause private investors to abandon the stock, management should avoid political favoritism after a stock exchange listing. The Article explores whether investors responded to indications of political favoritism as the above theory would predict. Case study evidence comes from major privatizations in Greece during the last two decades in telecommunications, energy, and gaming. The Article examines the public disclosures of partially privatized companies in two key areas where the risk of political side-deals and corruption remains high: contracts with suppliers and relationship with labor. Greek companies&#x26;#x27; disclosure documents included clear indications that payouts to suppliers and labor continued to increase during the period of partial privatization. However, these companies&#x26;#x27; stocks remained attractive to investors. </description>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;This essay outlines the ongoing debate on the justice deficit of EU private law &#x26;#x2013; the &#x26;#x2018;social justice&#x26;#x2019; debate &#x26;#x2013; and then points at an underexplored avenue of inquiry that is essential for this debate to stay meaningful and constructive. Future research should aim to calibrate EU private law to the socio-economic asymmetries of the EU market, and to counterbalance the uneven weight of uniform rules, where they appear desirable, with proper compensatory mechanisms. </description>

&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;There is a general consensus that sustainability and solvency of US Social Security and Medicare is questionable with enormous fiscal imbalance on these programs of public welfare. In this paper, we propose that extent of this imbalance can be much more than what is currently predicted by Social Security Administration or some of the earlier studies on the subject. We suggest that the estimates of fiscal imbalance should incorporate the progress in medical sciences. This progression is likely to increase the longevity at an exponential rate in age cohort 65  warranting higher benefit payments compared to current forecasts of SSA. Our estimates reveal that if deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases and cancer are eliminated; the fiscal imbalance will be as high as USD 87 Trillion in present value. Given the current pace of biological innovations, the likelihood of elimination of these diseases is not improbable and if that happens, the sustainability of these programs is impossible with the status quo. </description>
