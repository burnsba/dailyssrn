&#x3C;p&#x3E;Abstract:
&#x3C;br&#x3E;There is a general consensus that sustainability and solvency of US Social Security and Medicare is questionable with enormous fiscal imbalance on these programs of public welfare. In this paper, we propose that extent of this imbalance can be much more than what is currently predicted by Social Security Administration or some of the earlier studies on the subject. We suggest that the estimates of fiscal imbalance should incorporate the progress in medical sciences. This progression is likely to increase the longevity at an exponential rate in age cohort 65  warranting higher benefit payments compared to current forecasts of SSA. Our estimates reveal that if deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases and cancer are eliminated; the fiscal imbalance will be as high as USD 87 Trillion in present value. Given the current pace of biological innovations, the likelihood of elimination of these diseases is not improbable and if that happens, the sustainability of these programs is impossible with the status quo. </description>
